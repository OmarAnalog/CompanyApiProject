## About

CompanyApiProject is a backend Web API for CRUD operations and business logic around companies (example domain). It is implemented in C# using ASP.NET Core and intended as a starting point for a production-ready API.

---

## Features

- RESTful endpoints for company resources (CRUD).  
- Layered architecture (recommended): Controllers → Application / Services → Persistence.  
- Authentication & Authorization (placeholder — add details).  
- Configuration via `appsettings.json` and environment variables.  
- Unit / Integration testing (placeholder — add test runner details).

---

## Architecture & Patterns

This project is organized to be easily extended into common architectures:

- **Onion / Clean Architecture**: separate layers for Domain, Application, Infrastructure, and API (recommended).  
- **CQRS / Mediator**: if you use `MediatR`, commands/queries live in Application and handlers contain the logic.  
- **Repository / Unit of Work**: used in the Infrastructure layer to abstract data access.

> Replace or remove the above lines if your code structure differs.
